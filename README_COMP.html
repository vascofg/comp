		<h3>SUMMARY:</h3> 
		<p>Our tool reads a regular expression, converts it to an automaton, and then turns it into java code.</p>

		<h3>DEALING WITH SYNTACTIC ERRORS:</h3> 
		<p>The program, when dealing with syntactic errors, alerts the user about the error that occurred and gives him the opportunity to make a new insertion. The program closes only when requested by the user.</p>

		<h3>SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:</h3>
		<p>Semantic analysis does not cover our work since we're working with regular expressions.</p>

		<h3>INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS (IRs):</h3>
		<p>At this work we only use abstract syntactic tree (AST), which is an high-level intermediate representation of the introduced regular expression after syntactically analyzed.
		</p>

		<h3>CODE GENERATION:</h3>
		<p>Our tool has some class files such as Automaton, State and Connection which are essential to represent the generated automata. The automata are stored as a Serializable class which is loaded when the user runs the generated java code.
		</p>

		<h3>OVERVIEW:</h3>
		<p>We use an algorithm developed by us to convert regular expressions to DFA.</p>

		<h3>TESTSUITE AND TEST INFRASTRUCTURE:</h3>
		<p>Our test suite has 6 automata generated from regular expressions with the help of the site <a href="http://hackingoff.com/compilers/regular-expression-to-nfa-dfa">HackingOff</a> and compares them with those generated by our program.
		</p>
		<h3>HOW TO USE:</h3>
		<p>
		  We have two jars included in the ZIP which can be used to generate and implement the automata.<br>
		  Generate.jar takes a regex and converts it to an automaton, saving it in the same folder with a chosen name. It also creates a DOT file and an SVG image if Graphviz is installed.<br>
		  Implement.jar reads this file and implements the automaton: it takes an input string and verifies if it passes in the automaton or not.

		<h3>TASK DISTRIBUTION:</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Luís Martins: Report and code generation.</li>
		<li>Rui Gonçalves: Syntactic and lexical analysis</li>
		<li>Vasco Gonçalves: Automata generaration</li>
		<li>Vítor Magano: Code generation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>PROS:</h3> 
		<ul>
			<li>Optimized Java code generation</li>
			<li>Generation of an image and DOT file with the automaton corresponding the regular expression entered, for easier visualization.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>CONS:</h3> 
		<ul>
			<li>It does not simplify the generated DFA.</li>
			<li>Not all types of regular expressions are accepted.</li>
		</ul>
